### ðŸ“‹ Turtle Library in Python

<p align="justify">
   Turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name. In short, the Python turtle library helps new programmers get a feel for what programming with Python is like in a fun and interactive way. Turtle is mainly used to introduce children to the world of computers. Itâ€™s a straightforward yet versatile way to understand the concepts of Python. This makes it a great avenue for kids to take their first steps in Python programming. That being said, the Python turtle library is not restricted to little ones alone! Itâ€™s also proved extremely useful for adults who are trying their hands at Python, which makes it great for Python beginners.

<b> Python Compatible Environment and Version for Turtle </b>
<p align="justify">
   Python Environment can be any of the applications among IDLE, Jupyter Notebooks. Python version has to be version-3 as Turtle is within the version-3 of Python. The good thing about turtle is that itâ€™s a built-in library, so ther's no need to install any new packages. The library can be put into use with just one line of code. Before beginning with libraries in  Python, understanding what a library is, is very important. In the non-computer world, a library is a place where different types of books are stored. These books can be accessed at any time, take whatever information you need from them, and return them to the same place.
In the computer world, a library works similarly. By definition, a library is a set of important functions and methods that you can access to make programming easier. The Python turtle library contains all the methods and functions that one need to create own set of images. To access a Python library, just import it into the Python environment, like this,
</p>

```
>>> import turtle
```

<b> Steps for executing Turtle Program in Python </b>
<p align="justify">
   
   - Import the Turtle module
   - Creating a seperate window
   - Creating a Turtle to control the flow
   - Graphic creation using the Turtle methods listed prior
</p>
</br>

<b> Program to demonstrate the Turtle library </b>
</br>
<p align="justify">
   A turtle screen has to be opened first, and a variable has to be initialized for it in the following way. It makes up a window called the screen, where all of the ouptut for the code can be viewed. The litte black triangular shape in the middle of the screen as shown in the figure  is called the turtle. 
</p>

```
>>> dev = turtle.getscreen()
```
