### ðŸ“‹ Variables in Python

<p align="justify">
   Variables in Python are identifiers just like in any other programming language. They can be treated off like a name given to a memory location. Once a variable is declared, the memory block could be located using only the variable name. Any operations on that particular memory location have to be performed using the variable name. Variables always need to go through two stages, one is declaration and other one is initialization. Variable declaration deals with assigning the user-defined identifier as a name to a memory location, and initialization is assigning a value to that particular memory location. In general, two stages are combined into a single statement but in most of the programming languages explicit definition of a datatype is necessary, which is not the case with Python.
</p>
<p align="justify">
   Python is not a "statically-typed" language, therefore variable declaration doesn't even exist. A variable is created only when a value is assigned to it. As the variable is being provided with the value it is going to hold beforehand, defining the datatypes is not needed. Just like in any other programming language, if the variable name is used and an operation is performed, the operations' result reflects the value held in the memory location.

### Rules for naming variables in Python
<p align="justify">
   There are certain rules that need to followed when naming variables. It is almost similar for all the conventional programming languages. The rulues for naming variables in Python are thereby,
